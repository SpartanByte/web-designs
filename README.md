### Projects

#### BrewMation

**BrewMation** is a _mock company_ I created that markets craft beers with the fun of snakes including snake breeds, behaviors, and states such as brumation. This came from the idea of our pet python named Django (after the Python programming framework).

_Brumation is a state of dormancy that reptiles and some other cold-blooded animals enter in response to cold weather, similar to hibernation in mammals. However, unlike hibernation, animals in brumation don't fall into a deep, inactive sleep. They remain semi-dormant, with periods of activity, and while they may not eat, they still drink to avoid dehydration._
