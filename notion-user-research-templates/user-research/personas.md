### üßë‚Äçüíª What are personas‚Äîand why do they matter?

Personas are fictional but evidence-based representations of your core user types. They help you and your team align around **who you‚Äôre building for**, **what really matters to them**, and **which user needs should shape your product decisions**.

Well-crafted personas are more than just profiles‚Äîthey're strategic tools. They connect research insights to roadmap decisions and ensure that your team doesn‚Äôt lose sight of the human side of the product.

## Properties

### Property Descriptions: Personas Database

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Persona Descriptive Name** | A unique, memorable label for this persona. Use something that reflects their role or mindset. |
| **Fictive First Name** | Give your persona a name to humanize them and make them easier to reference in discussion. |
| **Customer Segment** | Defines which segment this persona belongs to‚Äîbased on demographic, firmographic, behavioral or psychographic criteria. Common approaches include roles (e.g. HR Manager), industries, company size, tech-savviness, or lifecycle stage. |
| **Priority** | Use this property to assign a qualitative priority level to each persona: **Primary** (core target group), **Secondary** (relevant but not main focus), **Tertiary** (low direct relevance), **Negative** (not a target). |
| **Picture** | Adding a picture makes the persona feel more tangible and relatable‚Äîespecially when sharing with stakeholders or collaborators. A visual helps humanize data and creates mental recall. I‚Äôve included a selection of sample images to choose from [Illustrations](Personas%2024855a9c765b80b49956fd67af7ed97f.md) , but you can always upload your own symbolic or real-looking image to help visualize the persona. |
| **Relevant Quotes** | Paste key quotes or paraphrased insights from interviews or surveys. |
| **Criteria 1‚Äì5** | Choose criteria that reflect what makes a persona more or less attractive for your product.

| **Goals** | What is this persona trying to achieve in their work/life context? |
| **Pains** | What are their main frustrations or problems? |
| **Persona Description** | A full narrative that brings the persona to life. Combine motivations, context, behaviors and challenges. |

| **Status** | Tracks the current work status of a persona. Options: **Draft**, **In Research**, **To Review**, **Validated**, **Published**, **Deprecated**. |

| **Hypotheses** | Assumptions you have about this persona‚Äôs behavior, needs, or preferences. These can later be validated through interviews or experiments. |
